Fart
----

Fart is my own "standard library" for C++.

# What is Fart?

It's a pretty comprehensive library, if I must say myself – and new features are constantly being added, as I need them.

## Why

Because I love the interoperability of C++ – but I f***ng hate the C++ standard library! It's a necessary evil – thereby it's name.

## How to Use

The documentation is non-existing at the moment! I know how it works – and that is sufficient for me.

If you want to use it, then use it at your own risk. I use this in production code – but I wouldn't recommend you to do the same.

Check out the source code, if you want to learn how it works.
